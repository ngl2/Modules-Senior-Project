- Nicholas Liodos - "Rain & Clean" Car Wash Project - 
- Directions to install
1 - Create and connect to a mysql database 
   I used PhpMyAdmin w/ xampp
2 - Run the queries located in .../Rain&CleanCarWash/database/database.sql to create the tables needed, 
3 - Unzip and upload files to web server.
5 - If you use the default Xampp and PhpMyAdmin settings, the database should connect with no issues. If you have a custom username and password, you will need to edit those two items within .../Rain&CleanCarWash/application/config/database.php

6 - Navigate in browser .../Clean&RainCarWash/index.php
7 - Login = (username:admin||password:project2017)
